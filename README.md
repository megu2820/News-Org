INSTRUCTONS FOR THE SETUP
  1. Make sure you have Xampp installed in order to make a local web server on your system as this api accepts requests from localhost only.
  2. Once Xampp is installed browse to HTDOCS directory within the xamp installation, clone the repo and browse to localhost/newsorg to see the project.
  3. In case of any issue contact me.
